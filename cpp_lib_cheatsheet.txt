<iostream>

	- Contains function prototypes for the C++ standard input and standard output functions. This header file replaces header file <iostream.h>.

<iomanip>

	- Contains function prototypes for stream manipulators that format streams of data. This header file replaces header file <iomanip.h>.

<cmath>

	- Contains function prototypes for math library functions. This header file replaces header file <math.h>.

<cstdlib>

	- Contains function prototypes for conversions of numbers to text, text to numbers, memory allocation, random numbers and various other utility functions. This header file replaces header file <stdlib.h>.

<ctime>
	
	- Contains function prototypes and types for manipulating the time and date. This header file replaces header file <time.h>.

<cctype>

	- Contains function prototypes for functions that test characters for certain properties (such as whether the character is a digit or a punctuation), and function prototypes for functions that can be used to convert lowercase letters to uppercase letters and vice versa. This header file replaces header file <ctype.h>

<cstring>

	- Contains function prototypes for C-style string-processing functions. This header file replaces header file <string.h>.

<cstdio>

	- Contains function prototypes for the C-style standard input/output library functions and information used by them. This header file replaces header file <stdio.h>.

<fstream>

	- Contains function prototypes for functions that perform input from files on disk and output to files on disk. This header file replaces header file <fstream.h>.

<climits>

	- Contains the integral size limits of the system. This header file replaces header file <limits.h>.

<cassert>

	- Contains macros for adding diagnostics that aid program debugging. This replaces header file <assert.h> from pre-standard C++.

<cfloat>

	- Contains the floating-point size limits of the system. This header file replaces header file <float.h>.

<string>

	- Contains the definition of class string from the C++ Standard Library

<vector>, <list>, <deque>, <queue>, <stack>, <map>, <set>, <bitset>

	- These header files contain classes that implement the C++ Standard Library containers. Containers store data during a program's execution.

<typeinfo>

	- Contains classes for runtime type identification (determining data types at execution time).

<exception>, <stdexcept>

	- These header files contain classes that are used for exception handling.

<memory>

	- Contains classes and functions used by the C++ Standard Library to allocate memory to the C++ Standard Library containers.

<sstream>

	- Contains function prototypes for functions that perform input from strings in memory and output to strings in memory.

<functional>

	- Contains classes and functions used by C++ Standard Library algorithms.

<iterator>

	- Contains classes for accessing data in the C++ Standard Library containers.

<algorithm>

	- Contains functions for manipulating data in C++ Standard Library containers.

<locale>

	- Contains classes and functions normally used by stream processing to process data in the natural form for different languages (e.g., monetary formats, sorting strings, character presentation, etc.).

<limits>

	- Contains classes for defining the numerical data type limits on each computer platform.

<utility>

	- Contains classes and functions that are used by many C++ Standard Library header files.
